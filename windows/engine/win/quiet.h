// Makes an app's own sound very quiet (so only the shifted copy is heard) and, above all,
// always puts it back.
//
// How it stays safe:
//   - Before any change, the original volumes go into a restore list
//     (%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pitch Shift\restore.json), so a later start can fix things after a crash.
//   - Windows remembers an app's volume when the app quits, so an app that quit while quiet would
//     start quiet next time. Apps on the list are fixed as soon as they play again, and their
//     remembered volume in the registry is put back too.
//   - While anything is quiet, a "RunOnce" entry runs "PitchShiftTool restore" at the next sign-in.
