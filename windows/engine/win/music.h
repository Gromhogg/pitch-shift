// "What you hear": records the chosen apps (each with its helper processes) or all sound,
// changes the pitch, and plays it to the default speakers. The apps' own sound is made very quiet
// (see quiet.h) and the recording is boosted back up, so only the shifted copy is heard.
// Several apps can be chosen: each is recorded on its own and the recordings are mixed.
// "Advanced processing" (set_advanced) swaps Rubber Band alone for the Mac app's Advanced engine (made for music:
// keeps the bass deep going up and the top bright going down). It runs on its own thread (like on the Mac), so the
// recording threads only hand the sound over.
