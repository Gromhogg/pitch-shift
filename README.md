# Pitch Shift

Change the pitch of **what you hear** (any app, like Spotify, Apple Music or YouTube) and of **your voice** (as a mic called "Pitch Shift Mic" for Discord, Zoom and others), live, or turn your voice into a woman's or a man's (Mac). For Mac, and Windows (beta).

## Install on a Mac

**Download (double-click):**

1. Download **[PitchShift.pkg](https://github.com/Gromhogg/pitch-shift/releases/latest/download/PitchShift.pkg)** and double-click it.
2. Your Mac says it can't check the file. Click **Done**.
3. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway**. Type your password.
4. Click **Continue**, then **Install**. Pitch Shift opens when it's done.
5. Click **Allow** when your Mac asks about recording audio and using the microphone.

If you think this is a virus, you can check the source code and throw it into an AI model– I make this purely for fun.

**Or with Terminal** (skips steps 2 and 3): open Terminal, paste this line, and press Return.

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gromhogg/pitch-shift/main/install.sh | bash
```

Run either one again any time to update. Works on Macs with Apple silicon or Intel and macOS 14.4 or newer. Nothing else to install: Pitch Shift Mic comes with it.

## Install on Windows (beta)

**Beta:** tested on GitHub's Windows computers, not yet on many real PCs. Needs Windows 11 (x64 or ARM).

Open **PowerShell** (click Start, type `PowerShell`, press Enter), paste this line, and press Enter:

```
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gromhogg/pitch-shift/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

- Click **Yes** when Windows asks to allow changes.
- If a **VB-Audio** window opens, click **Install Driver**. This adds **Pitch Shift Mic**.

Or download **[PitchShift-Setup.exe](https://github.com/Gromhogg/pitch-shift/releases/latest/download/PitchShift-Setup.exe)** and open it. If Windows says **"Windows protected your PC"**, click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

## How to use it

**Output pitch shifter** (what you hear)

- Pick an app, or **All sound**.
- Click the big number to type an exact amount, like `2.5` or `-1.25`. 12 is one octave. Or use **−**, **0** and **+**.
- Turn on **Advanced processing** for music at bigger amounts: going up, the bass stays deep; going down, the top stays bright. A new amount takes a moment longer to kick in.
- With Advanced processing on, slide from **Bass** to **Treble** to suit your headphones (Mac). Pitch Shift remembers it for each pair of headphones or speakers.
- Turn on **Auto EQ** (Mac, with Advanced processing on) to keep the deep bass, mids and highs balanced like the original song. Its five small sliders move by themselves; drag one to nudge it, and double-click it or press **Auto** to go back. It's remembered for each pair of headphones or speakers too.
- Everything on the card can be set while it's off too (Mac): it's used when you turn the card on.

**Input pitch shifter** (your voice)

- Pick your mic, turn it on, and slide from **Natural** (sounds like a different person) to **Cartoon** (chipmunk or monster). On Windows, choose Natural or Cartoon.
- Set how much higher or lower with the big number or **−**, **0** and **+**, the same way.
- Turn on **Deeper when slow** and your voice goes lower while you talk slowly, then back when you talk normally (Mac).
- With it on, **Higher when fast** makes your voice go higher while you talk fast: the slider sets how much, from **Off** to **+8** half-steps (starts at +4).
- In Discord, Zoom or any other app, choose **Pitch Shift Mic** as your microphone.
- Press **Test** to record 5 seconds of your shifted voice and hear it back. With the AI voice changer on, Test waits for the AI voice's delay before it stops, so you hear all 5 seconds in the AI voice.
- Everything on the card can be set while it's off too (Mac): it's used when you turn the card on. **Test** works while it's off as well: your voice is changed just for the test, and the card stays off.
- Press **Sounds** for the Soundboard (Mac): add sound files with **+**, then click one to play it into your call. You hear it too; on your Mac's own speakers your voice is muted while it plays, so it can't echo.
- Drag sound files onto the Soundboard to add them. Right-click a sound to rename it, change its volume or remove it.
- The Soundboard works with **Input pitch shifter** off too: your mic then goes into the call unchanged (or through the voice changer, if it's on).
- Use headphones in calls. If your voice cuts out, turn off the call app's noise suppression (like Krisp).

**Voice changer** (Mac)

- Turn it on and pick **Woman** (for a man's voice) or **Man** (for a woman's voice). It works on its own: **Input pitch shifter** doesn't need to be on. Choose **Pitch Shift Mic** in your call app, as for **Input pitch shifter**.
- Slide from **Light** to **Full** to choose how strong the change is.
- Slide **Faster ↔ More real** to choose between speed and realism. All the way to **Faster** is the plain voice changer, with almost no delay. Anywhere to the right, an AI voice says your words again in the new voice, so it sounds like a real person (Macs with Apple silicon). The further right, the more of what you say next it hears before it speaks, so words come out clearer and steadier, but your voice reaches the call later: the card shows the delay ("Delay: about 0.46 s"), up to about one second all the way right. It starts a quarter of the way along: the least delay that speaks smoothly. The first time, the AI voice takes up to a minute to get ready; the plain voice changer plays meanwhile. Whenever the plain voice changer stands in for the AI voice, the card says **backup voice** next to the delay. With the AI voice, the **Light**…**Full** slider moves only the pitch, from **Your pitch** to the voice's. Moving the slider changes the delay at your next short pause (so nothing is cut or repeated), or within 1.5 seconds if you don't pause. Claps, finger snaps, knocks, clicks and whistles come through as they really sound instead of being turned into a voice; everything your voice makes (words, laughs, coughs, breaths) stays the AI voice.
- Holding a note ("aaah") keeps its pitch steady in both the plain and the AI voice changer.
- Since 3.3, the AI **Woman** and **Man** voices are trained on real recordings (8 speakers each), so they sound clearer and much cleaner in a noisy room. After updating, the first time you use each voice it again takes up to a minute to get ready.
- **Second voice for laughs & hums** (AI voice, on unless you turn it off): each AI voice has a second version that was trained on hums, hummed tunes, laughs, sighs, breaths and singing. Pitch Shift listens to what you're doing and uses it only for those; talking always uses the main voice, and so does anything it isn't sure about. Clicks, claps and typing never go to it. Turn the switch off to use the main voice for everything.
- Only one at a time: turning the voice changer on turns **Input pitch shifter** off, and turning **Input pitch shifter** on turns the voice changer off. Each keeps its own settings (pitch, sliders, **Deeper when slow**, voice) for next time. The mic menu, **Test**, **Sounds** and the Pitch Shift Mic light in the **Input pitch shifter** card work with either one on; with the voice changer on, **Test** plays the changed voice.
- Add your own voices with the **⋯** button next to the voice menu (see [Your own voices](#your-own-voices)).

**Output pitch shifter** can be on at the same time as either of the other two. Closing the window keeps Pitch Shift running. Quit it with ⌘Q.

**Pitch Shift Pro ($5, Mac)**

- Free: **Output pitch shifter** with Advanced processing, and **Input pitch shifter** in the Cartoon style, with **Test**.
- Pro adds the **Voice changer** (with your own voices), the **Natural ↔ Cartoon** and **Bass ↔ Treble** sliders, **Auto EQ**, **Deeper when slow** (with **Higher when fast**) and the **Soundboard**. They show a small lock until you unlock them.
- To get a key, click **Unlock Pro** at the top right, then **Email for a key** (or email cbsweetland@gmail.com). Copy the whole key from the email you get back (it's long, 4 lines; spaces and line breaks don't matter), paste it in and click **Unlock**. It works on all your Macs, for good, with no internet needed. Keys sent out before (25 characters) keep working.

## Your own voices (Mac)

The voice changer can also use voices you download. They sound best as an AI voice (Macs with Apple silicon): put the **Faster ↔ More real** slider anywhere right of **Faster**.

- **Where to find voices:** people share RVC voices on sites like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?search=rvc) (search for "RVC v2"). You need the voice's `.pth` file (it often comes in a `.zip` with an `.index` file, which Pitch Shift doesn't need). Voices made at 32, 40 or 48 kHz work; older "v1" voices don't.
- **Turn it into a Pitch Shift voice:** open Terminal, paste this line, type a space, drag the `.pth` (or `.zip`) file onto the Terminal window, and press Return:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gromhogg/pitch-shift/main/tools/convert-voice.sh | bash -s --
```

- It asks how high the voice is (High for most women's voices, Low for most men's). The first time, it downloads what it needs (about 0.5 GB, a few minutes) into `~/Library/Application Support/Pitch Shift/Converter` (delete that folder to remove it). It never asks for your password. After that, each voice takes about half a minute.
- The new voice shows up in the Voice changer's voice menu. Pick it and move **Faster ↔ More real** right of **Faster**. A voice converted before Pitch Shift 3.1 still plays, but without hearing ahead (it can stutter a little more); convert its `.pth` again to fix that.
- **The Voices folder:** click the **⋯** button next to the voice menu, then **Open Voices Folder**. Each voice is a folder in there. In the same menu, **Add Voice…** adds a voice folder (or a `.zip` of one) that someone shared with you, and **Rename…** and **Remove** change the voice you picked. Built-in voices can't be removed.
- Voices copied from a real person, and fan-made voices of characters, are your own responsibility: only use voices you're allowed to use, and don't pretend to be someone you're not.

## If something goes wrong

- **The app you picked goes silent:** quit Pitch Shift and it plays normally again. Then turn Pitch Shift on in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen & System Audio Recording** and open it again.
- **No "Pitch Shift Mic" in your call app:** restart your Mac.
- **Your voice is silent:** turn Pitch Shift on in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone**.
- **Soundboard sounds cut out in Discord:** Discord's noise filter (Krisp) treats sounds as noise. Use headphones, then in **User Settings → Voice & Video** set **Input Profile** to **Studio**. Or pick **Custom** and turn off **Noise Suppression**, **Echo Cancellation** and **Automatic Gain Control**.

## Uninstall (Mac)

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gromhogg/pitch-shift/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

## Build it yourself (Mac)

```
xcode-select --install
brew install rubberband
./build.sh
```

`build.sh` builds `Pitch Shift.app` for Apple silicon and Intel (with Pitch Shift Mic inside), puts it in Applications and puts a shortcut on your Desktop. The first time, it downloads the source of Rubber Band and libsamplerate to build the Intel part (`libs/build.sh`), and the Realistic voice changer's AI model files (about 130 MB, listed in `voices/models.txt`; without them the app still builds and only the Natural voice changer works). `packaging/make-pkg.sh` makes the installer, and `./release.sh 1.2.3` posts a new version.

Pitch Shift Pro: the app's side is `Sources/Pro.swift` and `Sources/ProConfig.swift`, and keys are made with `tools/pro-keys.sh` (`setup` once, then `new "name"`). Keys are signed: the private half of the key pair stays in `~/Library/Application Support/Pitch Shift Keys/` and makes keys; `build.sh` builds in only the public half (`signing-public.txt` there, or `PRO_PUBLIC_KEY`), which can check keys but not make them, plus fingerprints of the older keys listed in `issued.txt` (or `PRO_ISSUED`) so they keep working. A build without the public key has nothing locked. Back up the whole Pitch Shift Keys folder: without it no more keys can be made. The [server/](server/README.md) folder isn't used yet.

## How it works

- **Output pitch shifter:** a macOS audio tap grabs the app's sound and mutes the original. [Rubber Band](https://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/) changes the pitch, and the result plays on your current speakers or headphones. It never changes your Mac's sound settings.
- **Advanced processing:** going up, the bass is shifted an octave less so it stays bass; going down, the song's very top is kept; and a slow tone control keeps the song's overall balance like the original's. Details: [notes/advanced-processing-research.md](notes/advanced-processing-research.md).
- **Input pitch shifter:** your mic goes through Rubber Band's low-delay shifter (from 6 half-steps up or down: Pitch Shift's own pulse shifter, which moves each pulse of your voice whole, so big shifts don't buzz) into "Pitch Shift Mic", a virtual mic built from [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) that comes with Pitch Shift (you don't need to install BlackHole). It only runs while an app is listening to Pitch Shift Mic.
- **Soundboard:** sounds are added to Pitch Shift Mic after your voice, at their normal pitch and an even loudness (very loud, squashed sounds are turned down to match the others); each sound also has its own volume (0–150%). While a sound plays, voice and sound are kept under −3 dBFS, so call apps don't get them clipped. On your Mac's own speakers, your mic is muted while a sound plays, so the call never hears it twice.
- **Voice changer:** Pitch Shift follows the pitch of your voice and moves it to a typical woman's or man's pitch (about 235 or 112 Hz, keeping your ups and downs, a bit bigger for Woman), and Pitch Shift's pulse shifter makes the change, moving each pulse of your voice whole (so the big move doesn't buzz) and changing the shape of the voice (its formants) the way a smaller or larger throat would. A light tone control then moves the sound toward the average woman's or man's voice. It adds no delay. It learns your usual pitch while you talk, but not while you hold a note, so a held note stays where you sing it.
- **Realistic voice changer:** an AI voice model (RVC v2 with the ContentVec speech reader) says your words again in the new voice. It runs on your Mac with Core ML (nothing goes online), only on Apple silicon. It works in pieces of 0.16 s and waits about 0.28 s to have enough of your voice to work with, plus up to 0.7 s more to hear what comes next (the **Faster ↔ More real** slider): with that, each piece is made knowing the sound after it, so the pieces join smoothly instead of stuttering, and it follows your pitch smoothly (holding a note stays steady). Toward the right end, part of that time is kept in hand instead (up to about 0.37 s), so a busy moment on your Mac doesn't make it fall behind; if pieces still come late because a game is using the graphics chip, it moves the voice model to the main processor by itself. If it ever falls behind, the plain voice changer fills in, so the call never hears silence or your own voice. Short sounds that are not a voice (claps, snaps, knocks, clicks) and whistles are passed through as the mic heard them, at the same delay: while it waits it checks that they die away like a click and that nothing else sounds within 0.3 s of them (a clap while you talk stays the AI voice); when in doubt it keeps the AI voice. Since 3.5 each voice has a second AI voice for hums, laughs, sighs, breaths and singing: a small sound sorter (YAMNet, with one extra layer trained for this) listens to the same second of sound and picks, piece by piece, the main voice for speech and anything unsure and the second voice for those sounds; it switches only after two pieces in a row and blends the two voices over the switching piece. It puts no tone on hiss or room noise, doesn't turn the room's noise up in pauses, and keeps its loudest moments under the level where sound starts to bend. The voices were trained on recordings of 8 speakers each from a public speech collection (VCTK; Woman's are all American), as one voice, so they are not copies of a real person. Voices you add work the same way; ones made before Pitch Shift 3.1 play without the look-ahead (convert them again for it). Details: [notes/voice-changer-plan.md](notes/voice-changer-plan.md).
