// Echo: the voice comes back every 0.28 s, a little thinner and darker each time. Full is a first repeat at half the
// voice's level, then each one under half of the last, so 5 or 6 can be heard. It can't run away: each trip round
// the loop takes the repeat down to 0.45 or less (the filters only take away, and softLimit caps what's stored), and
// all repeats added up stay under the voice, even on a note held for ever (0.5 / (1 - 0.45) = 0.91). While you talk
// the repeats are turned down, measured against your own recent loudness so a quiet mic works the same; they come up
// in the pauses.
//
// Radio: more and more like a small radio as the slider goes up: a narrower band of sound, a peak where small speakers
// ring, the tops of the waves worn off, and at the far end light static that follows the voice (none in silence). It
// sounds like AM radio about halfway and a walkie-talkie at full. How hard the waves are hit follows the voice's
// loudness, so a quiet mic gets the same grit as a loud one. The voice stays about as loud all along the slider.
//
// Radio comes first, so the echo repeats the radio's sound. Slider moves glide over about 30 ms. At 0 an effect is
// skipped and what it holds is cleared, so old speech can't come back later. Makes no memory on the sound thread (the
// delay line is made in init, freed with free()) and never waits.
