// Advanced processing engine for "What you hear": pitch shifting that keeps the music balanced at big shifts.
// Recipe ("balanced3", from the research rounds 2-4, with the bass fix and the tone fix made after 2.0.0): the bass is
// moved down an octave ("fold") for pitch-up, the original's top end ("air") is kept for pitch-down, and a gentle
// adaptive EQ steers the long-term tone back toward the original (going up, it no longer cuts bass notes that the fold
// moved; it knows which way the pitch went: going down it trims the deep bass, going up it keeps more of the top).
// Rubber Band (R3, real-time) does the shifting. A safety peak limiter at the very end keeps the output at or below
// -0.3 dBFS (it does nothing while the sound stays under that).
//
// Plain C API, so Swift can call it through the bridging header.
// Threading: create, use and delete from one thread at a time (the engine also runs one helper thread of its own
// that tidies up spare Rubber Band shifters; it never touches the sound).
// Real-time safe: advanced_process, advanced_set_semis, advanced_set_tone, advanced_set_auto_eq,
// advanced_get_auto_eq and advanced_reset make no memory, take no locks and do no file or console I/O. Everything is
// set up in advanced_new. advanced_get_auto_eq may also be called from another thread.
