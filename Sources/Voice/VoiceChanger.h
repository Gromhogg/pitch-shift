// Voice changer, "Natural" mode: turns a voice into the chosen voice (Woman, Man, ...) without AI.
// It works next to the voice's Rubber Band shifter (VoiceShifter.swift):
//   mic -> voicechanger_analyse (pitch tracker, pitch mapping, creak) -> sets Rubber Band's pitch + formant scale
//       -> Rubber Band -> waiting sound (VoiceRing) -> voicechanger_post (sibilance, tone EQ, presence, breath) -> out.
// Analysis runs next to the sound and post uses only filters that work sample by sample, so it adds no delay.
//
// Plain C API (C++17 inside, no Apple APIs), so Swift can call it through the bridging header.
// Threading: create, set up (tune) and delete from one thread; analyse, post, set, reset and get_stats from the sound
// thread. Real-time safe: analyse, post, set, reset and get_stats make no memory, take no locks and do no file or
// console I/O. Everything is made in voicechanger_new.
