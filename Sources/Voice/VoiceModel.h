// Voice changer, "Realistic" mode: an AI voice model (RVC v2 style: a ContentVec encoder + one voice generator per
// voice) run with Core ML on its own worker thread. Apple silicon only; on Intel every call says so and the app keeps
// using Natural mode.
//   sound thread: voicestream_push (copies the mic + the pitch from voicechanger_analyse) and voicestream_pull (takes
//   the finished AI voice, a fixed delay later; while loading, on a late piece or an error it plays Natural mode's
//   sound delayed to the same fixed delay instead, crossfaded; never the raw mic, except (3.4) for sounds that are
//   not a voice: claps, clicks, knocks, keys, whistles, which SoundGate.h lets through as they are). A new stream plays at its fixed
//   delay from the start: silence until Natural's sound reaches it, then the AI voice from its first piece.
//   worker thread (made by voicestream_new): resample, encoder, generator, crossfade into the output ring.
//
// Plain C API (Objective-C++ inside), so Swift can call it through the bridging header.
// Real-time safe: voicestream_push, voicestream_pull and voicestream_get_stats make no memory and take no locks.
