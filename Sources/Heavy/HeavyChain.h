// "Super Advanced" for What you hear: pitch shifting made for heavy songs. Distorted guitars are trains of sharp pulses,
// and a shifter that works on frequencies scrambles them, which makes loud songs watery and pushes their peaks over full
// scale. This one plays the sound like tape, r times faster or slower, so every waveform keeps its exact shape. To stay
// in time it jumps back or forward between drum hits, by the amount that lands the next hit on time, at the moment the
// sound before and after the jump match best. A safety limiter at the end keeps the output at or below -0.3 dBFS.
//
// Mac only (it uses Accelerate). Plain C API, so Swift can call it through the bridging header.
// Create, use and delete from one thread at a time. heavy_process and heavy_set_semis make no memory, take no locks and
// do no file or console I/O.
