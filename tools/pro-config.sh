# owner's signing key pair (64 hex characters), and the fingerprints of the older 25-character keys listed in
# ISSUED_FILE (issued.txt: "date  name  key" per line), each the SHA-256 of "PSPRO-OLD:" + the key (capitals, no
# dashes). Must match Sources/Pro.swift (ProKey.oldFingerprint). A missing ISSUED_FILE = no older keys.
# Prints only how many older keys were found, never the keys.
